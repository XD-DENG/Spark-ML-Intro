# Spark Machine Learning Introduction

In this repo, I try to introduce some basic machine learning usages of *PySpark*. The contents I'm going to cover would be quite simple. But I guess it would be helpful for some people since I would cover some questions I encountered myself from the perspective of a person who's used to more "normal" ML settings (like R language).

Some of the examples are from the official examples given by Spark. But I will give more details.
